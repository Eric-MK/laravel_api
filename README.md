##  Key notes

After creating a personal access client in Laravel Passport, you need to place the client's ID and plain-text secret value in your application's .env file for security reasons. The .env file is used to store configuration variables for your application, and Laravel automatically loads these variables into the application's environment at runtime.

By storing the client ID and secret in the .env file, you can ensure that sensitive credentials are kept separate from your application code and are not accidentally committed to version control systems or exposed to unauthorized parties. It also allows you to easily manage these credentials across multiple environments (e.g., local, staging, production) without hardcoding them in your codebase.

To use the personal access client in your application, you can retrieve the client credentials from the .env file using the env function provided by Laravel:


 .env file configuration for a Laravel Passport personal access client.

The PASSPORT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID variable represents the ID of the personal access client that you created in Passport, and the PASSPORT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET variable is the plain-text secret value that you generated for the client.

By adding these credentials to your .env file, you can easily retrieve them in your application code and use them to authenticate requests to your API using personal access tokens.

It's important to keep the PASSPORT_PERSONAL_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET value secure and not share it publicly, as it can be used to generate valid access tokens for your API. One way to ensure its security is to use environment-specific .env files (e.g., .env.production, .env.staging, etc.) and to make sure that these files are not committed to version control.
